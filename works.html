    <h2>Some of my projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <a href="https://github.com/362-Project/CPSC362----KnightHorse">Game: Software Engineering course group project-- Knight Horse</a>
        <p>In this project, I was tasked to form and make a group project for a course at CSUF called "Software Engineering CPSC362".</p>
        <p>In this project, me and five others teamed up to make a game that we worked on through-out the fall semester at CSUF of 2021.</p>
        <p>This game revolves around a player on horseback that travels through the world constantly being bombarded by enemies-- left, right, and center. </p>
        <p>This game is developed using Unreal Engine 4, as a group we had members that were both familiar and unfamiliar with the software which presented a learning curve to get all the members on the same page with equal work loads. </p>
        <p>This project helped me learn a lot about UE4 development and API development. We developed an API system that allowed users to call our system and retrieve our highscore leaderboards at anytime. </p>
        <p>This call would return a player's name and their respective scores which was used by another group to host a leaderboard of scores on their pizza website.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/Paiz0/Xcolor">Software: Xcolor</a>
        <p>In this project I contributed to an opensource project that hosted an android app that functioned to display all kinds of colors in pamphlet format. </p>
        <p>I contributed the change of modify the app's icon to the owners ideal icon, I also added other colors and shapes to the icon design.</p>
        <p>In this project I had to learn how to use android studio and have back and forth communications with the owner of the git to satisfy his needs for the project requirements.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/Paiz0/HelperBot">Utility: Discord Bot</a>
        <p>This is a personal project of mine that involves the creation of a highly customizable Discord bot that can be custom tailored to each user through the unique commands that each Discord server would want. </p>
        <p>The idea behind this project is to give the Discord user their choice of commands that suit their needs; anyone can use any of the already available Discord bots but they all come with predetermined use case scenarios -- but not this one.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/Paiz0/The_Runner_2D_Game">Game: The Runner 2D</a>
        <p>In this project I contributed to an opensource project that requested that someone make them a play, exit, restart, and next button for their game.</p>
        <p>This game was done in Unity engine and was a good chance for me to learn unity engine. I also got the chance to learn a little of C# for this project since Unity functions in C#.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/Paiz0/Qt-calculator">Software: QT-Calculator</a>
        <p>In this project, I contributed to a local open source GitHub that focused on making a custom made calculator program.</p>
        <p>I contributed to this project by changing the theme of the calculator and changing UI elements involved on the screen of the calculator.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/Paiz0/AlienInvaders">Game: Alien Invaders (python)</a>
        <p>In this project, I attempted to take on making my own version of the classic Alien Invaders game. </p>
        <p>This project was written in python and helped me both learn the language and learn the intricacies of project management and game development.</p>
    </ul>
