    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Andrew and I'm an aspiring computer science student at CSUF. I hope to be graduating by the end of 2022 and wish to pursue a career in either software engineering or game development. Computer science and involvement in computer related fields have always been a hobby and interest of mine. It started with me taking an interest in computer hardware, building my own computers, understanding the intricacies that make the machine run -- inside and out. This passion further developed when making my decision to either pursue a degree in computer engineering or computer science, ultimately choosing computer science due to the thrill when creating and forming working software. After dabbling with game development through various projects and software development through open source contributions, I've become more excited for this career choice and hope to find a path that leads to computer science development.</p>
